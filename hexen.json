Three heroes set out to destroy Korax. The player assumes the role of one such hero. Throughout the course of his quest, he travels through elemental dungeons, a wilderness region, a mountainside seminary, a large castle, and finally a necropolis, before the final showdown with the Serpent Rider.",
    "summary": "While you were battling the evil forces of D\u0027Sparil, the other Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions. One such dimension is the decaying world where Hexen takes place. A world littered with the mangled corpses of nonbelievers and inhabited by the undead followers that executed them. Only three humans; a warrior, a mage and a cleric; have escaped the leaders\u0027 vicious spell. Now these brave souls have sworn to crush the evil regime that threatens to destroy the world forever. Separated upon entering the mystical portal, the three are forced to attempt on their own what they had hoped to do together: find Korax\u0027s stronghold, destroy him and restore order in the physical world.\n\nBecome one of 3 heroes. Wield superhuman powers and lethal weapons.\nWalk. Run. Fly. Look all around. Inflict serious pain.\nPillage your way through earthquakes, crumbling bridges and fog.\nTrack down powerful artifacts and cast wicked spells.\nFour sick individuals can wreak havoc via network, two by modem.",

    "summary": "The PlayStation version has the FMV scenes and audio music from the PC CD-ROM version, but no multiplayer mode. The scripting and animation is slower, enemies have only their front sprites and lack gory deaths when attacked by strong hits or weapons, and the frame rate is slower.\n\nAlthough all levels are present in this version and feature their correct layouts, their architecture details are somewhat simplified and there is some loss in overall lighting quality. This port is based on a beta version of the original PC version of Hexen as many gameplay tweaks are shared, such as the simpler level design and the Fighter\u0027s fists being weaker compared to other versions.",
