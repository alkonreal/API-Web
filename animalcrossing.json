However, being a spirited youth, the child forgot to find a place to live first and has only the clothes on their back and 1,000 Bells. On the train, Rover sits across from them and drums up a conversation. During the exchange, the cat finds out about the childâ€™s situation. Rover contacts Tom Nook and arranges for his old friend to help out the boy or girl upon their arrival.",
    "summary": "Occasionally strange but completely addictive, Nintendo\u0027s Animal Crossing for the GameCube is not so much a game as a simulation of life on a small town. Players begin the game by setting out to live life on their own in a colorful town, where they are greeted by a seemingly endless supply of things to do and characters to meet.\n\nTime passes in Animal Crossing in real-time, as the month, day, season, and time of day matches that of the player\u0027s. Holiday seasons come and go in Animal Crossing, just as they would in the real world. Experience the freedom to fish, decorate your house, go bug catching, garden, write letters, and even play original Nintendo NES games in this imaginative, and addictive game.",

    "summary": "Players move into a living, breathing world inside the Nintendo DS...and then invite their friends to visit from anywhere on earth. In Animal Crossing: Wild World, the sequel to the popular Nintendo GameCube game, players and up to three friends can hang out in the same village and interact in real time -- either through wireless LAN or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players can visit a friend\u0027s village from thousands of miles away. The touch screen makes item management and world navigation a breeze. Typing letters and designing patterns are now just stylus strokes away. Days and seasons pass in real time, so whether players want to decorate their homes, catch bugs or fish, collect brand-new items like hats and sunglasses or just chat with the wild and wacky characters in their villages, there\u0027s always something to do.",
