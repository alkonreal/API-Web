    "storyline": "\"A colossal mass of derelict ships, asteroids and debris, known as a Space Hulk, has spilled from the Warp. It’s entered into a system where the Imperium is already beset by a Tyranid hive swarm - the immense Space Hulk is dubbed ‘Olethros’.\n\nThe Dark Angels Chapter of the Space Marines answer the astropathic emergency calls from beleaguered worlds in the system. However, it’s a more important quest that ultimately draws the Dark Angels to the warzone.\n\nAzrael - Supreme Grand Master of the Dark Angels - receives dire premonitions from his psychic Librarians and dispatches a strike fleet to Olethros. Belial – Grandmaster of Dark Angels’ 1st Company, the Deathwing – is charged with boarding the Space Hulk.\n\nAzrael’s psykers believe the strange visions emanating from Olethros foretell disaster. Not only this, but they seem intrinsically linked with the distant past of the Dark Angels chapter.\n\nYou are the Librarian who has been chosen to enter the Genestealer-infested Space Hulk with your squad. In Space Hulk: Deathwing, you’ll venture deep into Olethros in order to uncover the dark secrets within…\"",
    "summary": "Space Hulk: Deathwing is a First-Person Shooter experience of Games Workshop\u0027s classic Space Hulk boardgame set in the universe of Warhammer 40,000, developed on Unreal Engine 4 by Streum On Studio, the team behind E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. Published by Focus Home Interactive and co-produced by Cyanide Studio, Space Hulk: Deathwing offers players the chance to experience a desperate battle against Genestealers in the claustrophobic tunnels of a Space Hulk, as they will gain skills, new abilities and new equipment thanks to experience earned during perilous missions.\n\nSpace Hulks drift along the currents of the Warp, the immaterial dimension of Chaos. Made up of gigantic mangled asteroids, derelict ship wrecks and other spatial debris, they sometimes grow to the size of a moon and often contain treasured and ancient lost technologies. However, they are ripe with danger including infestations of the lethal Genestealers.\n\nPlayers take on the role of a Space Marine from one of the most secret and most feared Space Marine Companies: the Deathwing from the Dark Angels. Strap on your Terminator armour and equip the emblematic weaponry of the Space Marines to overcome the threats awaiting you in the Space Hulk. As a Librarian, you will also master the destructive powers of the Psykers. Your skills and performance in battle grant you Fervor Points, to spend on 4 skill trees allowing you to improve your abilities, unlock new powers, access powerful relics and devastating new weapons.",
